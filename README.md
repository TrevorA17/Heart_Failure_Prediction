# Heart Failure Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart failure using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various clinical features such as age, gender, medical history, and physiological parameters. We employed the Random Forest algorithm to build the predictive model due to its ability to handle complex relationships and provide robust predictions. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. After training the model, we evaluated its performance using cross-validation techniques and assessed its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we developed a RESTful API using the Plumber package in R, allowing users to interact with the model and make predictions in real-time. This project serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in assessing the risk of heart failure in patients and guiding clinical decision-making.
